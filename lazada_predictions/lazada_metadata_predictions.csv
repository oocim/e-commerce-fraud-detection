CPU series i3-9800f (Intel CPU) / R3 (AMD CPU) or higher. 2. For H-series motherboards such as H61/H81, the CPU is recommended to be 7th generation or below. Please use 1155-pin CPU on H61 motherboard and 1150-pin CPU on H81 to avoid damage to the chip and motherboard. 3. The A320 series graphics card is best to use CPU below R5, such as R3. ✅ PSU: The power supply requires more than 500W (real power supply). Due to insufficient power, the motherboard will lose power and the computer will display ""No Signal"". ✅ RAM: Buyers don't need to worry about memory module adaptation problems. The memory module just needs to make sure it can adapt to the motherboard used. ✅ Monitor: RX580 8G is suitable for monitors with DP & HDMI interface. Please note that if buyers use an adapter to convert the DP and HDMI ports to VGA ports, they need to ensure the monitor performance can be matched to the RX580 8G. This means that buyers need to ensure that the monitor's performance can adapt to the RX580 8G when using an adapter. ✅ Chassis: Buyers are requested to keep the chassis in good heat dissipation condition. The chassis temperature will not exceed the internal temperature of 60 degrees Celsius during running.

In addition to featuring 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM with a 192-bit memory interface, this GPU features 20 Xe cores with a 2670 MHz clock speed. With 160 XMX AI Engines, the Arc B580 delivers up to 233 TOPS (Trillions of Operations per Second) to upscale graphics, optimize gaming performance, and accelerate generative AI content creation. The 20 ray tracing units provide realistic lighting and reflections with compatible games. The front panel includes three DisplayPort 2.1 outputs and one HDMI 2.1 port. For cooling, Intel implemented dual fans, which maximize downwards airflow and air dispersion to the heat sink below them. Xe2 Architecture Compared to the previous generation, the Intel Arc B-Series GPUs offer 70% better performance per Xe-core and 50% more performance per watt. The B580 GPU delivers 24% faster performance with 1440p games than the Intel Arc A750 GPU, with some games being up to 78% faster. XeSS 2 Intel's Xe Super Sampling (XeSS) is updated with three key technologies: XeSS Super Resolution, XeSS Frame Generation, and Xe Low Latency. XeSS Super Resolution offers AI-based upscaling for over 150 supported games. AI-powered XeSS Frame Generation delivers a more fluid visual experience by adding interpolated frames using optical flow and motion vector reprojection. Lastly, Xe Low Latency integrates with the game engine to provide faster responsiveness. With all three technologies active, XeSS 2 can increase the fps output by up to 3.9x compared to the previous generation, delivering high performance with demanding AAA games. Powerful Media Engine Intel's Xe Media engine features twin multi-format transcoders (MFX) that are designed to support faster, higher-quality creation and playback of video. The GPU also has expansive hardware encode and decode codec support, such as AV1, H.265, H.264, and VP9 with 4:2:2 10-bit depth.",19999.0,28995.0,4.9,0,5.0,12,"Perfect!!!

Before using them, it is recommended to consult the official manuals of graphics cards and external devices to confirm the specifications and parameters (such as resolution and refresh rate) that support the adapter to avoid flicker and black screen. 2. Interface matching: Make sure that the adapter interface type is completely matched with the video card output interface and the input interface of the external device (such as HDMI to DP, DVI to VGA, etc.). Mismatching may lead to signal transmission failure, equipment burning, and even short circuit risk.3.AMD official website graphics driver download:https://www.amd.com/zh-hans/ ●.AMD official website graphics driver download:https://www.amd.com/zh-hans/",8825.41,11473.03,4.8,0,5.0,7,"Functionality：Testing for now, i will edit the review after sa mga test, Wuwa game has a 53 Degrees Celsius max temp.

The GPU features 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM and a 128-bit memory interface, offering improved performance and power efficiency over the previous Ampere-based generation. The front panel of the card features a variety of outputs, such as DisplayPort 1.4a and HDMI 2.1. HDMI 2.1 supports up to 48 Gb/s bandwidth and a range of higher resolutions and refresh rates, including 8K @ 60 fps, 4K @ 120 fps, and even up to 10K. The RTX 4060 Ti is not just about high-resolution gaming. Computationally intensive programs can utilize the GPU's 4352 cores to accelerate tasks using CUDA and other APIs. For cooling, Gigabyte implemented the WINDFORCE 3X cooling system. The three fans feature alternate spinning to reduce turbulence and increase airflow pressure. The 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans will remain off when the GPU is processing a low load or low-power game. The airflow is spilt by the triangular fan edge, and guided smoothly through the 3D stripe curve on the fan surface. The graphene nano lubricant can extend the life of the fans and is quieter. It also has RGB Fusion, which has customizable color options and a variety of lighting effects.

Using CPUID's hardware monitor, the gpu's information was named 'TRIAL', indicating them as prototypes or beta version. This explains why i'm getting lower core clocks than expected. It is a stripped down 5700xt, comparable to the rx 5600xt/rx 5700according to 3DMark banchmarks. GPU-Z reports its core clock to be the supposed values of a 5700xt but MSI afterburner and AMD's Adrenaline Software report it to have a core clock of 1390MHz and I was only able to boost it at exactly 1431MHz. Memory clock was okay and was running at it's supposed speed (1780MHz). Power consumption can only be boosted to 20% in afterburner. Any values other than these, it only goes back to the original values. It seems like the manufacturer locked any overclocking capabilities of this card. This might be to compensate the substandard cooling system installed in it. The model I got seems to have (painted?) aluminium heatpipes unlike the 'seemingly' copper ones displayed in the pictures. I also noticed some crooked heatsinks.

[Vktech] Vertical Graphics Card Holder Kit with 15cm PCI-E 4.0 X16 Riser Cable GPU Bracket Holder GPU Mount Graphic Card Bracket,"BrandVktech | SKU4474002280_PH-25488771982 | Cooler_TypeFanless | Slot OccupancySingle Slot | Warranty TypeNo Warranty | Vertical Graphics Card Holder Kit with 15cm PCI-E 4.0 X16 Riser Cable Video Card Support Kit 90 Degree Right Angle GPU Mount Graphic Card Bracket Feature: 1. High-Speed PCIe 4.0 Extension Cable Compatibility: The gpu mounting bracket comes with a PCIe 4.0 extension high-speed cable compatible with most GPU/motherboard components, supporting PCIe 4.0/3.0/2.0/1.0 applications. For motherboards with PCI-E 4.0 specifications, enter the motherboard BIOS to manually set the PCI-E option to 4.0 (GEN4), ensuring optimal performance and compatibility. 2. Enhanced Performance with EMI Shielding: Our graphics card holder kit features a PCIe adapter cable made from the latest materials, offering effective EMI shielding to prevent interference and performance degradation. This attention to detail ensures your GPU operates at its peak without being compromised by external factors. 3. Optimal Cable Length and Connector Design for Easy Installation: The video card support kit is designed with a 15 cm cable length and a 90° female PCIe connector, minimizing cable strain and allowing for easy GPU installation in compatible cases. This thoughtful design caters to both functionality and aesthetic, ensuring a seamless fit within your system. 4. Sleek, Flat, and Foldable Cable Design for Efficient Management: With its slim, flat, and foldable design, the gpu bracket holder ensures efficient transmission, stability, and easy cable management within your setup. This design not only improves the internal look of your PC but also enhances airflow, contributing to a cooler and more efficient system environment. 5. Transmission Speed Considerations for Maximum Compatibility: The gpu mount graphic card bracket's performance is subject to the compatibility between the motherboard and the graphics card. It's important to note that the actual transmission speed will match the lower version of either the PCI-E graphics card or the motherboard's PCI-E 16X slot (e.g., if the PCI-E graphics card is 3.0 and the motherboard's PCI-E 16X is 4.0, the actual transmission speed will be 3.0, and vice versa), ensuring users are aware of their system's capabilities for optimal performance.
